# Inventory Management System

Hey there! This is a simple inventory management system I made to keep track of the products. 

## What it does

- Keeps track of all your products and their quantities
- Shows you when stuff is running low
- Lets you add/edit/delete products
- Has a nice looking UI
- Works on mobile too!

## How to use it

First, you gotta install all these commands:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the server:

```bash
npm run server
```

And in another terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
npm run client
```

Thats it! Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000` and start managing your inventory.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products with ease
- **Stock Tracking**: See how much of each product you have
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Get warned when stuff is running low
- **Search & Filter**: Find products quickly
- **Responsive Design**: Works on any device

## Technology

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the basics)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MySQL
- Authentication: JWT

## Known Issues

- Sometimes the modal doesn't show up
- Mobile view could be better
- No dark mode yet (coming soon)
